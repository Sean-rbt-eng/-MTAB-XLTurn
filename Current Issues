Using Instructions from AET Labs, we are currently able to connect the machine to the CNC Train application and run the test program that was left by the person who trained us. It cuts a star pattern into pieces of Corian countertop, that are 100mm by 100mm. 

What We Can Do

	Connect the machine to the CNC Train app

	Run the test program Adam left for us (it cuts a star shape into the Corian)

	Trace an image, and turn it into a DXF

 	Image to G-Code

		Image to DXF

		DXF to Toolpath in CNC Design

		Toolpath to G-Code

	Set a Datum on the machine

What We Cannot Do
	
	Successfully run G-Codes we have created
	
	Save a workpiece home

Problems

	Over Travel on Y-Axis

	Datum resets every power cycle

	CNC Train crashes very easily
	
	5mm slot drill tool gets deleted every power cycle
